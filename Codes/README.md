# ResNet Model Builder in KERAS for 1D and 2D CNN
Run the Jupyter Notebook (suggested in Google Colab or in a similar platform for GPU usage if it is not available locally) while uploading the ResNet model and using it to train 1D and 2D signal data, test and evaluate. Modify the pipeline as you wish.

It can be used for both Classification or Regression based on what you select in the Configuration. Classification will return output in terms of predefined classes while Regression will extract a certain number of features which can be utilized for regression tasks.
