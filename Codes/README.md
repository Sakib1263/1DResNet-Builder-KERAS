# ResNet Model Builder in KERAS for 1D_CNN
Run the Jupyter Notebook (suggested in Google Colab or in a similar platform for GPU usage if it is not available locally) while uploading the ResNet model and using it to train 1D signal data, test and evaluate. Modify the pipeline as you wish.

It can be used for both Classification or Regression based on what you select in the Configuration according to your needs. Classification will return output in classes and while Regression will extract a certain number of features which can be further utilized to predict some other parameters.
