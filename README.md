# 1DResNet_KERAS
This repository contains an One-Dimentional (1D) version of original variants of ResNet developed in KERAS along with implementation guidance in Jupyter Notebooks  
Read more about ResNets in this original paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf  
The models in this repository have been built following the original paper's implementation as much as possible, though more efficient implementation could be possible due to the advancements in this field since then. The models implemented in this repository are:
1. ResNet18
2. ResNet32
3. ResNet50
4. ResNet101
5. ResNet152

Overview of all the architectures from the original document is as follows:
